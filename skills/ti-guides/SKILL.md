description: "Master of Titanium SDK best practices, architecture, native access via Hyperloop, app distribution, and configuration. Use when Claude needs to: (1) Optimize memory and bridge efficiency, (2) Implement modular architecture (CommonJS/Alloy), (3) Access native APIs directly via Hyperloop, (4) Manage database transactions and image memory, (5) Standardize coding styles and conventions, (6) Distribute apps to Google Play/App Store, or (7) Configure tiapp.xml and CLI settings."

# Titanium SDK Guide Expert

This skill ensures Titanium projects follow TiDev standards for stability, performance, and cross-platform reliability.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Architecture Check**: Validate that the project follows a modular pattern (CommonJS or Alloy).
2.  **Memory Review**: Ensure all global listeners are removed and heavy objects are nulled during cleanup.
3.  **Bridge Optimization**: Identify and cache frequently accessed native properties to minimize bridge crossings.
4.  **Native Integration**: Use Hyperloop for specialized native functionality, ensuring proper casting and thread management.
5.  **Asset Management**: Optimize database operations with transactions and manage image memory footprints.

## Procedural Rules (Low Freedom)

-   **Memory Hygiene**: Always remove `Ti.App` and `Ti.Geolocation` listeners in the controller cleanup phase.
-   **No Bridge Calls in Loops**: Never access `Ti.Platform` or `Ti.DisplayCaps` inside loops; store values in local variables.
-   **Hyperloop Naming**: Concatenate selectors accurately (e.g., `addAttribute:value:range:` -> `addAttributeValueRange`).
-   **DB Persistence**: Always close resultsets and database handles after every transaction block.
